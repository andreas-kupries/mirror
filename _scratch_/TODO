[ ]	Repository - Retarget = Change url
  	Alternative: add url, merge to set, remove old url
	Retarget can be internally this, with shortcuts.
	Ensures that url is ok, and VCS matches

[ ]	Ability to archive a store/mset - Rename! Disable repositories.
  	Note: Must allow re-adding the same url in new repositories!
	
	This is when an author or maintainer drops a repository and
	puts a new into the same place. And we want to keep the old
	while tracking the new.

	url would not be unique anymore ...

	Alternative: Make url nullable ... Add a new column for archived url.
		     For archived repos/mset move url into new archive column.

	Alternative:
		Make url unique within the mset.
		With the entire mset archived a new mset can have the same url.

	Trouble: We are not really archiving the mset, but the store ?!
	In that case the url and repository can be unchanged.
	The store is inactive, the new active store may point to the
	previous store.

	To handle current issue => Ability to export/save a store, future
	import as archived ?

[ ]	Add a search command, like we have for the web interface
